Debit card There were some safety equipment required by the race that I didn’t use, and I didn’t finish all my food thanks to there being plenty of food available at the aid stations, but overall I didn’t overpack and felt good about my gear.\nPre-race check-in I got to Bosan station the evening of the race, as racers could start checking in a day before the race. When I got there at around 18:00, the area was full of trail runners, and I felt right at home with my people.\nI scanned a QR code to virtually que for check-in, and since I had some time to kill, I walked around the venue and visited some pop-up booths of some of my favorite running brands, especially the Garmin booth.\nAfter checking in, I received my bib (#826), and I went to a nearby motel to rest and get ready for the race.\nThe run Getting ready The race was supposed to start at 06:00 on Saturday, so I checked-out at around 05:20 to check in my bag. After checking in my bag, I headed to the starting line at 05:45, which was already packed with runners by then.\nWhile waiting for the starting gun, I couldn’t help but notice that I was the only runner wearing minimal shoes (that I could see), and most were wearing maximalist shoes. Different strokes for different folks, but I personaly think that everyone can benefit from incorporating minimalist shoes to strengthen the feet and legs and to get attuned to listening to your feet’s receptors. Plus, feeling the ground while running is fun!\nDespite the initial starting time of 06:00, the race ended up getting delayed by around 15 minutes. But at 06:15, the countdown started, and everyone was off to the races.\nAnd so it begins testing4\nLessons learned ",

<p>There were some safety equipment required by the race that I didn&rsquo;t use, and I didn&rsquo;t finish all my food thanks to there being plenty of food available at the aid stations, but overall I didn&rsquo;t overpack and felt good about my gear.</p>

<p>I got to Bosan station the evening of the race, as racers could start checking in a day before the race. When I got there at around 18:00, the area was full of trail runners, and I felt right at home with my people.</p>

<p>I scanned a QR code to virtually que for check-in, and since I had some time to kill, I walked around the venue and visited some pop-up booths of some of my favorite running brands, especially the Garmin booth.</p>

<p>After checking in, I received my bib (#826), and I went to a nearby motel to rest and get ready for the race.</p>

<p>The race was supposed to start at 06:00 on Saturday, so I checked-out at around 05:20 to check in my bag. After checking in my bag, I headed to the starting line at 05:45, which was already packed with runners by then.</p>

<p>While waiting for the starting gun, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that I was the only runner wearing minimal shoes (that I could see), and most were wearing maximalist shoes. Different strokes for different folks, but I personaly think that everyone can benefit from incorporating minimalist shoes to strengthen the feet and legs and to get attuned to listening to your feet&rsquo;s receptors. Plus, feeling the ground while running is fun!</p>

<p>Despite the initial starting time of 06:00, the race ended up getting delayed by around 15 minutes. But at 06:15, the countdown started, and everyone was off to the races.</p>
